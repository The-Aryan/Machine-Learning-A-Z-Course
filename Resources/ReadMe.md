-   Regression is used when we have to predict a continuous real value.
-   Classification is used when we have to predict a categorical value.

-   Assumptions of Linear Regression (Anscombe's Quartet (Lec. 58))

    -   Linearity

        -   Linear relationship between Y and each X

    -   Homoscedasticity

        -   Equal Variance

    -   Multivariate Normality

        -   Normality of error distribution

    -   Independence

        -   Observations includes 'no auto correlation'

    -   Lack of Multicollinearity

        -   Predictors are not correlated with each other

    -   The Outlier Check

-   Always omit one dummy variable to avoid Dummy Variable Trap
